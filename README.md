# PCMart Website
This was a project that I worked on in collaboration with others for CISC275. It is an e-commerce website for PC parts built using TypeScript, JavaScript, and React. Currently, the project is almost entirely frontend, with a little bit of firebase for the backend. The project was built over the course of ~6 weeks with an agile methodology via 1-week sprints.
